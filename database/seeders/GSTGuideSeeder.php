            'content' => '<h2>1. What Is GST and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST), introduced on July 1, 2017, revolutionized India\'s taxation by unifying multiple indirect taxes like VAT, service tax, excise, and Octroi into a single, comprehensive tax. It is a multi-stage, destination-based tax applied throughout the supply chain, ultimately borne by the end consumer. This design prevents cascading taxes and brings transparency.</p>

<h2>2. The GST Structure & Components</h2>
<p>GST operates on a dual model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CGST (Central GST) and SGST (State GST)</strong> apply to intra-state transactions.</li>
<li><strong>IGST (Integrated GST)</strong> applies to inter-state transactions, with revenue shared between states and the center.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tax regime also features robust Input Tax Credit (ITC) rules, enabling businesses to offset input GST against output GST—as long as credits are used appropriately (e.g., CGST credit for CGST, etc.).</p>

<h2>3. GST Tax Slabs: Navigating the Rates (2025 Update)</h2>
<p>Current GST rates include: <strong>0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%</strong>. Here\'s how they apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>0%:</strong> Essentials like milk and educational services</li>
<li><strong>5%:</strong> Everyday necessities like tea, coal, and edible oils</li>
<li><strong>12%:</strong> Goods like butter and computers</li>
<li><strong>18%:</strong> Mainstream goods and services like toiletries</li>
<li><strong>28%:</strong> Luxury or sin goods like cars and ACs</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. GST Registration: Who Must and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Mandatory GST registration applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goods suppliers with turnover above <strong>₹40 lakh</strong> (₹20 lakh in special states)</li>
<li>Service providers above <strong>₹20 lakh</strong> (₹10 lakh in special states)</li>
<li>Those engaging in interstate supply or e-commerce</li>
<li>Reverse-charge mechanisms</li>
<li>Non-resident taxable persons</li>
<li>Distributors of input services</li>
</ul>
<p>Even businesses below thresholds may opt for voluntary registration to claim ITC and enhance credibility.</p>
